Notes on game:
Monster is a friend of the main character.
Main character and monster were both researchers on a project to harness powers from other worlds.
For the experiment to work, it is necessary for subjects to have their memories taken away. That way they are a blank canvas for abilities from other worlds to take hold.
In the original experiment, the subject had their memories erased and was free to roam the facility. Searching as they went.
This lead to the original subject discovering the corrupted world first. Unable to control the power of transformation he discovered, he turned into a monster.
The researchers apprehended him and locked him in a storage closet, intending to discover a way to change him back. His needs were provided for.
It was the intention of the researchers in the second experiment to lock off all of the portals at first. Allowing the MC to get comfortable in the environmnet and get used to their life of solitude in the lab.
Unfortunately, as the player explores they discover that someone has left the code to the storage closet written in a notebook. They unlock the storage closet and release the monster.
In order to save the player, their fellow researchers who are observing, unlock the gate to the first world immediately.
